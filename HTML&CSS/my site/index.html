		<h2>What are cupcakes?</h2>
		<p>
			A <strong>cupcake</strong> is a small cake designed to serve one person,
			which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup.
		</p>
		<p>
			As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit
			and candy may be applied.
		</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>
			The earliest extant description of what is now often called a cupcake was
			in 1796, when a recipe for "a light cake to bake in small cups" was
			written in American Cookery by Amelia Simmons.<a href="#firstLink"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="#secondLink"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The earliest extant
			documentation of the term cupcake itself was in "Seventy-five Receipts for
			Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts
			cookbook.<a href="#thirdLink"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href="#fouthLink"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the term cup
			cake or cupcake. In previous centuries, before muffin tins were widely
			available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups,
			ramekins, or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked in.
			This is the use of the name that has remained, and the name of "cupcake"
			is now given to any small, round cake that is about the size of a teacup.
			While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcake, they
			are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate frosting.
		</p>
		<p>
			The other kind of "cup cake" referred to a cake whose ingredients were
			measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup, instead of being weighed.
			Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could
			also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as
			layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was
			firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as 1234
			cakes or quarter cakes, so called because they are made up of four
			ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour,
			and four eggs.<a href="#fifthLink"><sup>[5]</sup></a><a href="#sixthLink"><sup>[6]</sup></a> They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and
			less expensive than pound cake, due to using about half as much butter and
			eggs compared to pound cake.
		</p>
		<p>
			The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the
			method to the baker; "cup cake" uses a volume measurement, and "pound
			cake" uses a weight measurement.<a href="#fifthLink"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
